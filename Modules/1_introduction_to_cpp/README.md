# Introduction to C++
C++ is one of the most powerful and versatile programming languages in the world. It is an extension of the C programming language, with additional features like classes and objects which make it possible to implement object-oriented programming (OOP). Invented by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 at Bell Labs, C++ has been the language of choice for system/software development, game development, and high-performance applications.

## Historical Background
Bjarne Stroustrup began his work on C++ in 1979. The motivation behind C++ was to combine the high efficiency and performance of C with features that made large-scale software development easier. It was originally named "C with Classes", but was later renamed to C++ in 1983, where the "++" signifies the increment operator in C - symbolically indicating an evolution from C.

## Key Features of C++
1. Object-Oriented:
C++ introduced the concept of classes and objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, which allows for modeling real-world entities and their interactions.
2. Low-level Memory Manipulation:
Like C, C++ allows for direct memory manipulation using pointers, giving a programmer a lot of control (and responsibility) over computer resources.
3. Rich Standard Library:
C++ comes with a vast standard library known as the Standard Template Library (STL) which provides a collection of generic algorithms and data structures.
4. Performance:
Due to its capability to operate at a low level, C++ is often chosen for system development or applications where performance is crucial.
5. Platform Dependent:
Typically, C++ code needs to be compiled for each platform it runs on. However, with the correct considerations, it's possible to write platform-independent code.
6. Extensions of C:
Being a superset of C, nearly all of C's features and properties are present in C++ - hence, a good C programmer finds it relatively easier to transition to C++.

## Setting up Visual Studio 2019 for C++ Development
### 1. Installation:
If you haven't already installed Visual Studio 2019:

- Download the Visual Studio 2019 installer from the [official website](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2019/release-notes).
- Run the installer.

### 2. Select Workloads:
During the installation process, you will be prompted to select the workloads you want. Check the box for Desktop development with C++. This will install the necessary tools for C++ development, including the MSVC compiler, libraries, and debugging tools.

### 3. Installation Path and Space:
Before you finalize the installation:

- Check the total space required, ensuring you have enough disk space.
- Optionally, you can change the installation path if you wish to install Visual Studio in a location other than the default.

### 4. Install:
- Click the `Install` button.
- Wait for the installation process to complete. This may take a while depending on your internet speed, as the installer will download necessary components.

### 5. Launch Visual Studio:
Once the installation is complete:

- Launch Visual Studio 2019.
- The first time you launch, you'll be prompted to sign in with a Microsoft account. This step is optional but can be useful for syncing settings between devices.

## Basic Syntax
Before diving into syntax details, let's explore the classic "Hello, World!" program. You can find the program example here: [HelloWorld.cpp](https://github.com/T3mps/CodingLodestar/blob/main/Modules/1_introduction_to_cpp/what_is_cpp/HelloWorld.cpp).

In that file, you'll see how to use the standard input-output stream library to print "Hello, World!" to the console, marking many learners' first step into the world of C++.
